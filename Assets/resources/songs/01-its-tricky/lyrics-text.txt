This speech is my recital, I think it's very vital
To rock (A rhyme),
that's right (On time)
It's Tricky is the title, 
(here we go)

(It's Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time)
It's Tricky, (it's Tricky) Tricky (Tricky) Tricky
(It's Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time)
(It's tricky), tricky (Tricky) tricky

(I met this little girlie, her hair was kinda curly
Went to her house and bust her out, I had to leave real early)
These girls are really sleazy, all they just say is please me
Or spend some time and rock a rhyme, I said "It's not that easy"

(It's Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time)
It's tricky (How is it D?) It's tricky (Tricky) tricky (Tricky)
(It's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time)
It's (tricky) tricky (Tricky) tricky huh!
